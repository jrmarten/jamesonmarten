    <h2><font color="#810b15">unleashing the leader within™</font></h2>
      <ul>
        <p><em>Unleashing the Leader Within</em>™ is <strong>career acceleration through deep development</strong>. Unleashing gives people the courage to get out of their comfortable ruts and become great leaders.</p>
        <p><strong>Executives</strong> invest in <em>Unleashing the Leader Within</em>™ because they want to stretch and test their most talented managers — people who are the future of the company. Some people aren't living up to their potential or are disengaged. Others are high performing but are hungry to showcase their capabilities. In-house development is not working.</p>
        <div class="spacing">
        <p><strong>Our graduates report</strong> great results. Here are just a few of the outcomes they have reported:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Deep, permanent changes that are welcomed by their colleagues</li>
        <li>Rapid career advancement because they are more versatile and aware</li>
        <li>Quickly building a highly engaged and productive workforce</li>
        <li>Tackling initiatives that drive six- or seven-figure results to the bottom line</li>
        <li>Increased balance and rhythm, both at work and at home</li>
        <li>The comfort to lead with full authenticity and integrity</li>
      </ul>
    </div><br>
        <p>This is what <em>Unleashing the Leader Within</em>™ can do for your company. You can't afford mediocre employees in key positions. As a business person, you clearly understand the value of investment. <strong>The ROI for Unleashing</strong> is almost always a significant multiple of what you invest and is often immediate!</p>

        <p>Unleashing breaks down to this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Accepting that we often behave in comfortable "ruts", and understanding how that came to be;</li>
        <li>Stopping the automatic, unconscious responses that are easy for us and that make us comfortable (and often make others uncomfortable);</li>
        <li>Opening our eyes wide and making conscious choices that are much more effective;</li>
        <li>Trying new approaches and learning what works best in each situation;</li>
        <li>Become, as a result, considerably more versatile and agile - a leader who makes a real difference in every situation.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>We are <strong>absolutely better</strong> than anyone else at the toughest part of this formula — helping people become conscious.</p>

      <p>This Program...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>is either a public program for individuals, or a team program for key staff</li>
        <li>provides intensive coaching for bright, impatient people</li>
        <li>is a way for successful executives to amplify confidence, courage and social impact</li>
        <li>promotes partnering with colleagues rather than lone ranger heroics</li>
        <li>engages key staff to produce eyebrow-raising results and often a very significant financial impact</li>
        <li>is for people who want breakthrough execution</li>
        <li>stretches a capable team to beyond what they believe is possible</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>This Program is not...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>training</li>
        <li>a one-shot program</li>
        <li>a casual commitment</li>
        <li>theoretical, lecture-based or boring</li>
        <li>for cautious or low-performing managers</li>
        <li>a touchy-feely boondoggle</li>
        <li>stretches a capable team to beyond what they believe is possible</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Timing</strong>: Our programs occur only twice a year, and space is limited. While it's a challenge for people to change when their lives are hectic, it is often the best time. Lots of activity also means plenty of opportunities to climb out of the ruts they're in.</p>

      <p>We make good people great! Who do you have who could be great?</p>
