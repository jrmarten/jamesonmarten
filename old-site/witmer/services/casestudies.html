    <h2><font color="#810b15">coaching case studies</font></h2>
    <ul>
    
    <h3><strong>case 1: improving social/political skill</strong></h3>
    <p>"George" was VP/GM of a $400m technology company. His strategic brilliance helped achieve 20% annual growth. However, his "emotional intelligence" was flat and his scores from both 360 and employee engagement metrics were well below the 90% target. So George asked for assistance to develop broader social/political skill. Over the next eighteen months, we coached George to experiment with new ways to resolve conflict, develop relationships with customers and adjust his approach to the unique needs of different staff. Over time, his 360 and engagement scores from his people improved from the 60% range to an average of over 80%.</p>

    <h3><strong>case 2: toning down a strong personality</strong></h3>
    <p>"Paula" led a mid-sized service organization. She had many qualities that are typical of top leaders, including quick thinking, unflappable confidence and a good dose of impatience. Even though she could be charming, she received feedback that she was intimidating. After three short coaching sessions, Paula discovered that 15 seconds of "active listening" during key conversations changed her reputation. She is now learning to master the art of Socratic coaching.</p>

    <h3><strong>case 3: stimulating a bored, talented executive</strong></h3>
    <p>"John" was bored. After six years as VP Operations, he had turned around three plants and stabilized a LEAN culture. He loved his company and didn't want to leave, but his path upward was blocked. Working with his coach, John proposed a series of LEAN initiatives that eventually removed $14m in cost from sales and administration. Coaching focused on "influence" skills that were necessary to sell and implement the initiatives. John is no longer bored because as a result of his new skills, the CEO gave him a new acquisition to run.</p>
